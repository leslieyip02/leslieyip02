### About Me
👋 Hey! I'm Leslie Yip, and I'm pasisonate about games and problem-solving. I'm drawn to coding and building projects because I find the challenge to be genuinely interesting. 

📖 I am self-taught, but am awaiting enrollment into the National University of Singapore in 2023. I've completed a few courses, including the CS50 and GD50 courses hosted on EdX, as well as courses under freeCodeCamp.

🏗 I've also built quite a few projects, picking up various skills along the way. Most of my projects are web-based, and you can view them on GitHub pages. Many of these projects are built on JavaScript, but I have also experimented with the C# Blazor framework.

📗 Currently, I am learning Rust and am aiming to start learning TensorFlow.
